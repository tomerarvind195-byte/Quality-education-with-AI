## 🧠 How the AI Recommendation Works

```
User selects learning goal & domain
              │
              ▼
      Interest profiling
   (what do you want to learn?)
              │
              ▼
   Skill level assessment
  (beginner / intermediate / advanced)
              │
              ▼
     Matching Algorithm
  (score courses against user profile)
              │
              ▼
   REST API returns ranked results
   (sorted by relevance + rating)
              │
              ▼
  React frontend displays
  personalized course cards
```
